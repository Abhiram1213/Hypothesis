Hypothesis Test 1 (Working Mothers):

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average time that working mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day (μ ≥ 11).
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average time that working mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day (μ < 11).

Given data:

Sample size (n) = 1000
Sample mean (x̄) = 11.5 minutes
Population standard deviation (σ) = 2.3 minutes
Significance level (α) = 0.05 (5%)
We'll perform a one-sample Z-test for the population mean:

Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM):
SEM = σ / √n = 2.3 / √1000 ≈ 0.0726

Calculate the Z-statistic:
Z = (x̄ - μ) / SEM = (11.5 - 11) / 0.0726 ≈ 6.87 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Find the critical value for a one-tailed test at α = 0.05:
Using a Z-table or calculator, you can find that the critical value for a left-tailed test at α = 0.05 is approximately -1.645.

Compare the Z-statistic to the critical value:
Z-statistic (6.87) > Critical value (-1.645)

Make a decision:
Since the Z-statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is enough evidence to conclude that the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is less than 11 minutes per day.

Hypothesis Test 2 (Coffee Shop's Wait Time):

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average wait time for customers at the coffee shop is greater than or equal to 5 minutes (μ ≥ 5).
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average wait time for customers at the coffee shop is less than 5 minutes (μ < 5).

Given data:

Sample size (n) = 40
Sample mean (x̄) = 4.6 minutes
Sample standard deviation (s) = 0.8 minutes
Significance level (α) = 0.05 (5%)
We'll perform a one-sample t-test for the population mean:

Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM):
SEM = s / √n = 0.8 / √40 ≈ 0.1265

Calculate the t-statistic:
t = (x̄ - μ) / SEM = (4.6 - 5) / 0.1265 ≈ -3.97 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Find the critical value for a left-tailed test at α = 0.05:
Using a t-table or calculator, you can find that the critical value for a left-tailed test with 39 degrees of freedom at α = 0.05 is approximately -1.685.

Compare the t-statistic to the critical value:
t-statistic (-3.97) < Critical value (-1.685)

Make a decision:
Since the t-statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is enough evidence to conclude that the average wait time for customers at the coffee shop is less than 5 minutes.
